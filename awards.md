# Awards

We currently seek sponsorships to award the best contribution and support talented researchers for their travel to the workshop.
Please reach out if you are interested in becoming a sponsor of the TRL workshop 2022.

## Travel awards

We will financially support attendance of young talented researchers that are eager to attend the TRL workshop at NeurIPS 2022 in New Orleans but have limited access to financial resources. More information and the application form will follow soon.

## Best paper award

To motivate and reward excellent research contributions within the scope of the workshop, we will hand out a best paper award funded by one of our sponsors. More information follows soon.
