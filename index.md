### **About**

We develop large models to "understand" images, videos and natural language that fuel many
intelligent applications from text completion to self-driving cars. But tabular data has long been
overlooked despite its dominant presence in data-intensive systems. The majority (67%) of datasets
in Google Dataset Search, for example, contain typical tabular file formats like CSV and XLS.
Similarly, the top-3 most-used data management systems are all relational database management
systems (RDBMS). Besides dedicated tabular file formats and database systems, tables are widely
used for presenting data in documents, Wikipedia pages, papers, and presentations.

By learning latent representations from structured tabular data (possibly combined with other modalities
such as free-form text), pretrained table models have shown preliminary but impressive performance
for semantic parsing, question answering, table understanding, and data preparation. Considering that such tasks share fundamental properties inherent to tables, representation
learning for tabular data is an important direction to explore further. These works also
surfaced many open challenges such as finding effective data encodings, pretraining objectives and
downstream tasks. With the increased interest in the “modern data stack” and “data-centric AI”,
the time has come to consider tabular data as a first-class modality for representation learning and
stimulate advances in this direction.

The Table Representation Learning workshop is the first workshop in this emerging research area
and serves the following needs: 1) motivating tabular data as a first-class modality for representation
learning and further shaping this area, 2) show-casing impactful applications of pretrained table
models and discussing future opportunities thereof, and 3) facilitating discussion and collaboration
across the machine learning, natural language processing, and data management communities.
