# Call for Papers (preliminary)

## Scope

We invite submissions that address, or relate to, any of the following topics:
- Representation learning techniques for tabular data and full databases, e.g., architectures, data
encoding techniques, pre-training, fine-tuning and prompting strategies, multi-task learning, etc.
- Multimodal learning where tabular data is jointly embedded with, for example, natural language,
code (e.g. SQL), knowledge bases, visualizations/images.
- Downstream applications of tabular representations for tasks like data preparation (e.g. data
cleaning, integration, cataloging), retrieval (e.g. search, fact-checking/QA, KG construction), and
analysis (e.g. summarization, visualization, and query recommendation).
Preprint. Under review.
- Upstream applications of tabular representation models for optimizing table parsers/extraction
(from documents, spreadsheets, presentations), storage (e.g. compression, indexing) and processing
e.g. query plan optimization, cost estimation.
- Evaluations and analyses of tabular representation models, including the utility of language models
as base models versus alternatives.
- Applications of tabular representation models in production (industry).
- Challenges of maintaining and managing table representation models in a fast evolving context, e.g.
data updating, error correction, monitoring.
- New resources such as surveys, benchmarks and datasets, for tabular representation models.
- Formalization, surveys, visions and reflections to structure and guide future research.


### **Important dates**
- Submission open: 10 September 2022
- Submission deadline: <b>20 September 2022</b>
- Notifications: 20 October 2022
- Camera-ready, slides and recording upload: 3 November 2022


## Submission formats
The workshop will accept regular research papers and industrial papers. Submissions should follow
the NeurIPS proceedings format and choose the suitable category of:
- Short paper: at most 4 pages + references.
- Regular paper: at most 8 pages + references.


## Novelty and conflicts
The workshop does not accept submissions that have previously been published at NeurIPS or
other machine learning or related venues. We do invite submissions that have been published in,
for example, data management venues. Accepted papers will be published on the website but the
workshop is non-archival.


## Submission and review process
The submission and review process will be hosted through OpenReview (a link will follow soon). Authors of submitted work will be asked to mark (domain) conflicts of interest with the workshop organizers and the program committee, and reviewing will be handled accordingly. Each paper will be reviewed by three PC members in a single-blind manner. Reviewers will recommend submissions for oral or poster presentation.
